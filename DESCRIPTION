Description: The `aphylo` R package implements estimation and data imputation
         methods for Functional Annotations in Phylogenetic Trees. The core
         function consists on the computation of the log-likelihood of observing
         a given phylogenetic tree with functional annotation on its leafs, and
         probabilities associated to gain and loss of functionalities, including
         probabilities of experimental misclasification. `aphylo` works smoothly
         with popular tools for analysis of phylogenetic data such as `ape` R
         package, "Analyses of Phylogenetics and Evolution."
