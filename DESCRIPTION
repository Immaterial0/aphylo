Description: The `aphylo` R package implements estimation and data imputation
  methods for Functional Annotations in Phylogenetic Trees. The core function
  consists on the computation of the log-likelihood of observing a given
  phylogenetic tree with functional annotation on its leafs, and probabilities
  associated to gain and loss of functionalities, including probabilities of
  experimental misclasification. Furthermore, the log-likelihood is computed
  using peeling algorithms, which required developing and implementing efficient
  algorithms for recoding and preparing phylogenetic tree data so that can be
  used with the package. Finally, `aphylo` works smoothly with popular tools for
  analysis of phylogenetic data such as `ape` R package, "Analyses of
  Phylogenetics and Evolution".
