\title{Annotated Phylogenetic Tree}
\usage{
new_aphylo(annotations, edges)
}
\arguments{
\item{annotations}{Matrix of size \eqn{n\times P + 1}{n*P + 1}. Annotation data, where the first column is the nodeid (should coincide with the coding of the tree), the following columns are function annotations coded as \code{1} if the node has the function, \code{0} if the node doesn't has the function and \code{9} or \code{NA} otherwise (no information).}

\item{edges}{Integer matrix with two columns. An edgelist where each row is in the form of \code{(parent, offspring)}.}

\item{...}{Further parameters passed to the method.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{aphylo} with the following elements:
\item{annotations}{A matrix of size \eqn{n\times P}{n * P} with leaf functional
annotations. These can be either 0, 1, or 9 indicating no function, function, and
no information respectively.}
\item{offspring}{A list of size \eqn{n}. The \eqn{i}-th element of the list
can be either \code{NULL} (meaning no offspring), or a vector 
with the relative positions of the offspring from \eqn{1} to \eqn{n}.} 
\item{edges}{An integer matrix of class \code{po_tree}. An edgelist (see 
\code{\link{as_po_tree}}).}
}
\description{
The \code{aphylo} class tree holds both the tree structure represented as a
partially ordered phylogenetic tree, and node annotations. While annotations
are included for both leafs and inner nodes, the algorithms included in this
package only uses the leaf annotations.
