\usage{
approx_geodesic(edges, nsteps = 1e+05, undirected = TRUE, warn = FALSE)

shortest_path(edges, nsteps = 1e+05, undirected = TRUE, warn = FALSE)

\method{approx_geodesic}{aphylo}(edges, nsteps = 1e+05, undirected = TRUE, warn = FALSE)

\method{approx_geodesic}{phylo}(edges, nsteps = 1e+05, undirected = TRUE, warn = FALSE)

\method{approx_geodesic}{matrix}(edges, nsteps = 1e+05, undirected = TRUE, warn = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{edges}{Integer matrix with two columns. An edgelist where each row is in the form of \\code{(parent, offspring)}.}

\item{nsteps}{Integer scalar. Number of maximum steps for the approximation.}

\item{undirected}{Logical scalar. When \code{TRUE} (default), the edgelist is treated
as undirected (see details).}

\item{warn}{Logical scalar. When \code{TRUE} shows a warning after no further
steps are needed.}
}
\value{
A square matrix of size \eqn{n} with the shortest path between each
pair of nodes.
}
\description{
Given an adjacency matrix \eqn{A}, the geodesic can be approximated using
its powers, since each \eqn{(i,j)} element of \eqn{A^p} corresponds to the
number of \eqn{p} length steps between nodes \eqn{i} and \eqn{j}.
}
\details{
When \code{undirected = TRUE}, the function extends \code{edges} such that
\code{edges = rbind(edges, edges[,2:1])}.
}
\references{
This is a modified version of the function of the same name in the
R package \CRANpkg{netdiffuseR}.
